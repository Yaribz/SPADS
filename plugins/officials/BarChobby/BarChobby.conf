# Fallback mechanism used to send battle config updates to Chobby clients in
# case the lobby server does not support multicast for SAYBATTLEPRIVATEEX
# command:
#
# . disabled: do not send battle config updates (Chobby UI will be out of sync)
# . broadcast: use a SAYBATTLEEX command to broadcast battle config updates to
#              all clients in the battle room (non-Chobby clients will see JSON
#              data messages in the battle room chat)
# . unicast: use multiple SAYBATTLEPRIVATEEX commands to send battle config
#            updates to each Chobby client individually (generates a lot of
#            lobby traffic overhead, SPADS might be kicked for flood)
