# The listening TCP port for the LAN lobby server
listenPort:8200

# The WAN IP address used by the LAN lobby server for hybrid hosting, to communicate with remote clients from outside the LAN if any.
# This is either a WAN address available directly on the local system, or an external address used to NAT the traffic.
# If a NAT is used, the listening TCP port of the LAN lobby server must be forwarded statically, as well as the game hosting UDP port.
# Leave this setting empty to auto-detect the WAN IP address.
# Set this setting to "*" to disable WAN IP address auto-detection and disable hybrid hosting functionality.
wanAddress:

# The country code assigned to all clients connected to the LAN lobby server, in standard two-letter format (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
# (empty = use "??")
countryCode:

# Boolean specifying whether the lobby protocol extension that allows larger team and ally-team numbers must be used or not
# (this increases the maximum team and ally team numbers from 15 to 255, but it may cause problems with some lobby clients)
