[set:allowGhostMaps]
Allow ghost maps
-
If enabled and if dedicated Spring server is used (see [global:springServerType]), ghost maps will be available for "!list maps", "!set map", and "!map" commands (and automatic map rotation).
A ghost map is a map which isn't available locally on the server, but whose hash has been learned (refer to [global:autoLearnMaps] and/or "!learnMaps" command). Only the "choose in game" start position type is allowed for such maps.
Like normal maps, ghost maps still have to be included in current map list to be available (refer to [set:mapList]).

[set:autoLock]
Auto-lock mode
-
Specifies if and when battle lobby must be automatically locked/unlocked, based on the number of players.
When autoLock is set to "on", the battle lobby is automatically locked when target number of players (1) is reached.
The "advanced" auto-lock mode works in the same way, except that if there are more players than the target number of players (2) and teams cannot be made even (3), then battle lobby is automatically unlocked until enough players join for teams to be made even again.
(1) The target number of players is computed from [set:nbTeams], [set:teamSize], and [set:nbPlayerById] (target number of players = nbTeams * teamSize * nbPlayerById)
(2) This can happen when a spectator unspecs after battle has been automatically locked for instance
(3) i.e. current number of players in battle lobby isn't a multiple of [set:nbTeams]
-

- there are at least [set:minPlayers] players in the battle lobby
- the target number of players (1) is reached
- teams can be made even (2)
The "advanced" auto-balance mode works in the same way, except that it doesn't check if the target number of players is reached. It auto-balances as soon as all other conditions are fulfilled.
(1) The target number of players is computed from [set:nbTeams], [set:teamSize], and [set:nbPlayerById] (target number of players = nbTeams * teamSize * nbPlayerById)
(2) i.e. current number of players in battle lobby is a multiple of [set:nbTeams]

[set:balanceMode]
Balance mode
-
This is the balance mode used during both automatic (refer to [set:autoBalance]) and manual (refer to "!balance" command) team balancing operations.
Four balance modes are currently available:
The "random" balance mode simply balances players randomly.
The "clan" balance mode ensures players of the same clans (refer to [set:clanMode]) are in the same teams. Other players are balanced randomly.
The "skill" balance mode tries to balance teams according to player skills (refer to [pSet:skillMode] and [pSet:rankMode]), without respecting clans.
The "clan;skill" balance mode tries to balance teams according to player skills (refer to [pSet:skillMode] and [pSet:rankMode]), respecting clans (refer to [set:clanMode]).
-
random: balance players randomly, without respecting clans
clan: balance players randomly, respecting clans
skill: balance players according to their skill, without respecting clans
clan;skill: balance players according to their skill, respecting clans
-
clan;skill

[set:clanMode]
Clan mode
-
This is the clan mode used during balancing operations if [set:balanceMode] is set to "clan" or "clan;skill".
It determines how players are recognized as being in the same clan.
If [set:balanceMode] is set to "clan;skill" and maximum unbalance is specified (see below), it also determines how much unbalance implied by clans is allowed. Unbalance is measured as the relative percent difference of the standard deviation of estimated team skills between optimal balance (without clan management) and requested balance. If <maxUnbalance> cannot be honored, then clans aren't taken into account for balancing.
-
tag: players are considered as being in the same clan only if they have same tag in their names
tag(<maxUnbalance>): same, except clans are only taken into account if <maxUnbalance> (integer) can be honored when balancing
pref: players are considered as being in the same clan only if they have same [pSet:clan] value
pref(<maxUnbalance>): same, except clans are only taken into account if <maxUnbalance> can be honored when balancing
tag(<maxUnbalance1>);pref(<maxUnbalance2>): SPADS tries to balance by clan tag respecting <maxUnbalance1>. If it succeeds, then it also tries to handle [pSet:clan] values respecting <maxUnbalance2> (<maxUnbalance1> and/or <maxUnbalance2> can be omitted to remove balance constraint(s))
pref(<maxUnbalance1>);tag(<maxUnbalance2>): same, except it tries to respect [pSet:clan] values before clan tags
-
tag;pref(5)

[set:nbPlayerById]
Number of player by ID
-
Spring engine supports having multiple players controling the same units. The "nbPlayerById" preset setting specifies the target number of players controling the same units (i.e., sharing the same ID).
This is one of the three preset settings used by SPADS to determine the target battle structure (for battle auto-management in particular):
- [set:nbTeams] (number of teams in the game)
- [set:teamSize] (number of ID by team)
- [set:nbPlayerById] (number of player by ID)
-
Non-null integer
-
1

[set:teamSize]
Team size
-
Target size of each team (number of ID by team).
This is one of the three preset settings used by SPADS to determine the target battle structure (for battle auto-management in particular):
- [set:nbTeams] (number of teams in the game)
- [set:teamSize] (number of ID by team)
- [set:nbPlayerById] (number of player by ID)
-
Non-null integer
-
6

[set:nbTeams]
Number of teams
-
Target number of teams
This is one of the three preset settings used by SPADS to determine the target battle structure (for battle auto-management in particular):
- [set:nbTeams] (number of teams in the game)
- [set:teamSize] (number of ID by team)
- [set:nbPlayerById] (number of player by ID)
If nbTeams is set to 1, then SPADS will put all human players in team 1, and all bots in team 2. This special mode is usefull for "humans vs bots" type of games (chickens...)
-
Non-null integer
-
2

[set:minTeamSize]
Minimum team size
-
When auto-balancing, normaly [set:nbTeams] has higher priority than [set:teamSize], which means that if there aren't enough players to reach target battle structure, SPADS will try to put at least one player in each team before adding players to existing teams.
[set:minTeamSize] makes it possible to alter this behaviour: it specifies the minimum team size before starting to fill another team when auto-balancing. This is only useful for Team FFA, when there aren't enough players to fulfill target battle structure: it makes SPADS decrease the number of teams so that there are at least this number of people in each team.
If minTeamSize is set to 0, it simply makes [set:teamSize] have higher priority than [set:nbTeams] (it acts as if [set:minTeamSize] had same value as [set:teamSize]).
-
Integer
-
1

[set:extraBox]
Extra box
-
Specifies the number of extra map boxes required by current game, in addition to the normal start boxes.
Extra boxes are special boxes required by some specific game modes such as King Of The Hill. Contrary to normal start boxes, extra boxes are not used to specify a team start location. Instead, they are used to give special meanings to specific map locations.
SPADS uses this setting to manage totally independent groups of saved map boxes (one for each value of the extraBox setting).
-
Integer
-
0

[set:idShareMode]
ID share mode
-
Specifies how SPADS chooses which players are sharing IDs.
-
all: all players of each team are sharing ID (SPADS counts the number of players in each team to know if teams are even)
auto: [set:nbPlayerById] and [set:balanceMode] are used to determine shared IDs (SPADS counts the number of IDs in each team to know if teams are even)
manual: [pSet:shareId] (coop group) is used to determine shared IDs (SPADS counts the number of players in each team to know if teams are even)
clan: same as "manual", except that the clan tag is used as default [pSet:shareId] (coop group) value for clan players
off: ID sharing is totally disabled, even if players are sharing IDs in battle lobby (workaround for 16 IDs limit in lobby protocol)
-
auto

[set:minPlayers]

The !unlockSpec command allows players to unlock temporarily a battle so that they can join as spectator: the battle is unlocked and re-locked automatically as soon as they join it.
The "unlockSpecDelay" preset setting specifies both the maximum delay during which battle is unlocked to allow the spectator to join (if he didn't join during this time, the battle is re-locked anyway to prevent other players to join and think they can play), and the minimum delay before the same user can execute the !unlockSpec command another time.

<unlockTime>:<delayForRetry>
  where <unlockTime> is the maximum delay in seconds during which battle is unlocked to allow the spectator to join
        <delayForRetry> is the minimum delay in seconds before the same user can execute the !unlockSpec command another time
