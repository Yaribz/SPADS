To install SPADS on Linux/UNIX, you have to:
============================================

1) Ensure Perl, swig and g++ are installed and available in your PATH (all standard Perl core modules must be available, on some systems such as RedHat/Fedora/CentOS this requires installing a metapackage usually named "perl-core")
2) Run "./spadsInstaller.pl" (SPADS will be installed in current directory)
3) Check your configuration files, in particular "spads.conf", "hostingPresets.conf" and "battlePresets.conf"

Then you can run SPADS as follows:
"./spads.pl <spadsConfPath>" (for instance: "./spads.pl etc/spads.conf")



To install SPADS on Windows, you have to:
=========================================

1) Install ActivePerl Windows (x86) (available here: http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads) or Strawberry Perl (32bit) (available here: http://strawberryperl.com)
2) Ensure your Perl bin directory is in your PATH environement variable
3) Open a Command shell, go in the directory where you extracted SPADS installation files, and run "perl spadsInstaller.pl" (SPADS will be installed in current directory)
4) Check your configuration files, in particular "spads.conf", "hostingPresets.conf" and "battlePresets.conf"

Then you can run SPADS as follows:
"perl spads.pl <spadsConfPath>" (for instance: "perl spads.pl etc/spads.conf")



To install SPADS on macOS, you have to:
=======================================

1) Ensure Perl, swig and g++ are installed and available in your PATH
2) Install Spring server (check the locations of the unitsyc library, "spring-dedicated" and "Spring data directory", they will be asked during SPADS installation)
3) Install at least one mod in Spring data directory
4) Run "./spadsInstaller.pl" (SPADS will be installed in current directory)
5) Check your configuration files, in particular "spads.conf", "hostingPresets.conf" and "battlePresets.conf"

Then you can run SPADS as follows:
"./spads.pl <spadsConfPath>" (for instance: "./spads.pl etc/spads.conf")



If you have any problem, you can contact me (bibim) directly in Spring lobby or forums
